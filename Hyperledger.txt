Hyperledger 

- Iroha (c++ / mobile library)
	YAC consensus algorithm

Hyperledger Sawtooth is a blockchain framework with potential in IoT, manufacturing, finance, and enterprise. Hyperledger Sawtooth supports diverse requirements, including both permissioned and permissionless deployments, and a pluggable consensus algorithm. This framework also provides a revolutionary consensus algorithm, Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), that allows for versatility and scalability suited for a variety of solutions.

Hyperledger Sawtooth supports many different infrastructural requirements, such as:

Permissioned and permissionless infrastructure
Modular blockchain architecture
Scalability, which is good for larger blockchain networks due to higher throughput
Many languages for transaction logic.
